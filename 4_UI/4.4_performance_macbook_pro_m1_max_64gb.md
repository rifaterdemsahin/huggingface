this is my plan > A Weekend Adventure: From Cambridge to London, Milton Keynes, and Beyond

Friday – Departure from Cambridge (CB1)

The journey begins on a crisp Friday morning as Arya and I leave our cozy home in Cambridge (CB1). Our bags are packed, and the excitement is bubbling over. We’re ready for a weekend adventure with just the right mix of travel, exploration, and a bit of thrill! The plan is to reach London first, with minimal time on trains—keeping our travel under one hour. We’ll spend the evening soaking up London’s energy and resting up for an exciting Saturday.

Saturday – Milton Keynes and a Visit to Belthesy Park

Saturday morning, we board the train to Milton Keynes, aiming for a journey under two hours. Our main destination is the beautiful Belthesy Park. Arya is especially excited—she loves being outdoors, and I can already picture her running through the park’s lush greenery, stopping to admire the surroundings and spot interesting wildlife.

After a relaxed stroll and plenty of photos at Belthesy Park, we have something extraordinary planned: a two-person flight experience with Arya. It’s a chance for her to feel like a real co-pilot, soaring high and seeing the world from above. The thought of sharing this unique experience with her makes me feel like the coolest parent ever.

Sunday – Back to London and Homeward Bound

Sunday will be our easy return to London and then back to Cambridge, sticking to under two hours for the journey back. This weekend getaway is short but packed with memorable experiences—exactly what we needed to recharge and bond.

I can’t wait to share more details once we’re back! For now, it’s time to prepare for the trip and get ready for some unforgettable moments with Arya.
