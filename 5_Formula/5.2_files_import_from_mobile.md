Hereâ€™s a one-liner shell script that renames the files with the iteration format `4.1.1`, `4.1.2`, and so on, while removing the "WhatsApp" part from the filename:

```bash
i=1; for f in 'WhatsApp Image 2025-02-06 at 19.00.13'* 'WhatsApp Image 2025-02-06 at 19.00.14'*; do mv "$f" "4.1.$((i++)).${f##*.}"; done
```

### Explanation:
- `i=1`: Initialize the counter.
- `for f in 'WhatsApp Image 2025-02-06 at 19.00.13'* 'WhatsApp Image 2025-02-06 at 19.00.14'*`: Loop over all matching files.
- `mv "$f" "4.1.$((i++)).${f##*.}"`: Rename each file to `4.1.i` with the original file extension (`jpeg`).

Let me know if you want this to also include a different numbering scheme or to output a dry run before executing.
